"What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?"

    I needed to plan and create a course planner. It would need to fill two specifics tasks. Print a list of all the computer science courses in alphanumeric order and for a given course, print out its title and prerequisites. I also needed to understand which data structure would be best suited for the task based on performance and memory. Out of the three I had to choose, Vector, Hash Table, and BST, I had chosen BST. The main reason I had was that the in-order traversal made it easy to implement the needed sorted list while keeping an efficient search. 

"How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand."

    I went through the three data structure, Vector, Hash Table, and BST and I specfically compared them based on a few different neccesities for a good performances. Those being, load cost, lookup, memory management, and sorting. I chose BST as those it suited those needs well. I also wrote helpers to help with input and case, Trim, ToUpper, and SplitCSV to compare courses well. I created Course and Node types, inserted by course number, and printed through in-order traversal. I then wrote a menu specific to this projects needs. The first being loading file data to structurea and two being printing a alphanumeric list of the course. Number three being printing the course title and the prerequisites for any individual course. Number nine would be the exit to get out of the application.

"How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?"

"How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?"

"How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?"
